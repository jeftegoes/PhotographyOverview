# 1. Introduction

- Core Photography is about capturing light.

# 2. DSLR vs Mirrorless

# 3. Exposure

- **Definition**
  - How bright or dark image is.
- A photo that is too dark is **underexposed**.
- A photo that is too bright is **overexposed**.
- A photo where the subject **is not too dark** and **not too bright** but it looks **natural** is properly exposed.
- The important thing to remember with proper **exposure**, is that it's partly up to you as the **artist**, you may want your photo to be a little dark or to be a little bright, that can create some interesting and creative shots.

# 4. Aperture

- **Definition**
  - Aperture (Iris): The hole inside the camera lens that lets in light.
- **Increasing** the size of the aperture makes image **brighter**.
- **Decreasing** the size of the aperture makes image **darker**.
- The F-STOP or F-NUMBER is a scale that represents the size of the aperture.

- Not all lenses can adjust to all apertures.

## 4.1. Depth of field

- How much is in focus in the photo.

# 5. Shutter speed

- **Definition**
  - Shutter speed or exposure time is the length of time that the film or digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light.
- A camera only needs to capture a **fraction of a second** in bright light.
  - 1/30s
  - 1/60s
  - 1/125s
  - ...
- A faster shutter speed = less light is let in.
- A slower shutter speed = more light is let in.
- If the photo is too dark, try slowing down the shutter speed.
- Try shooting at least at 1/80 or 1/100 to reduce camera shake.
- Use a tripod to prevent camera shake when using a longer shutter speed.

# 6. ISO

- **Definition**
  - The sensitivity of camera's sensor to light.
- Increasing the ISO increases exposure.
- Descreasing the ISO decreases exposure.
- ISO scale
  - 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400...
- Increasing the ISO doubles the camera's sensitivity.
- Increasing the ISO too much can lead to digital noise/grain.
- On most entry-level cameras, recomended staying below ISO 1600.

# 7. Camera scene modes

- Automatically adjusts based on specific type of photography.
  - **Portrait mode**
    - Selects a lower F-STOP/aperture to get a blurred background.
  - **Macro mode**
    - Selects a mid-range aperture and meters for the entire frame.
  - **Landscape mode**
    - Select a higher F-STOP/aperture and meter for the entire frame.
  - **Sports mode**
    - Selects a higher shutter speed to freeze motion.
  - **Fireworks mode**
    - Selects a shutter speed that beautifully captures light streaks.
  - **Beach & snow mode**
    - Selects a fast shutter speed, high F-STOP/aperture and low ISO.
  - **Night mode**
    - Selects a high ISO, low F-STOP/aperture and low shutter speed.
  - Panoramic mode
    - Takes multiple photos and stitches them together to create a panorama.
- **Every camera has different scene modes.**

# 8. File types

- Most cameras have two file types: `JPEG` and `RAW`.
- **RAW images**
  - Uncompressed, full quality images (large file size).
  - Some cameras allow you to adjust the resolution of the original photos you are capturing.
  - When shooting in raw, plan to edit photos.
  - Make sure you have enough memory card space when shooting in raw.
- **JPEG images**
  - A universal file type that is compressed (smaller size).
- **Which file format should you use?**
  - It is recommended to always shoot in raw if possible.
  - You can usually capture both `RAW` and `JPEG` images at the same time.
