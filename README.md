# 1. Introduction

Core Photography is about capturing light.

# 2. DSLR vs Mirrorless

# 3. Exposure

- **Definition**
  - How bright or dark your image is.
- A photo that is too dark is **underexposed**.
- A photo that is too dark is **overexposed**.
- A photo where your subject **is not too dark** and **not too bright** but it looks **natural** is properly exposed.
- The important thing to remember with proper **exposure**, is that it's partly up to you as the **artist**, you may want your photo to be a little dark or to be a little bright, that can create some interesting and creative shots.
